=============================

FilesProcessor.java - The main class. This class receives two arguments: the directory of the files to sort and filter, and the command file.
FileFacade.java - a facade for the File class, contains basic operations that are performed on files, for example isFile(), getName() etc.
FileAnalyzer.java - This class is used to analyze the file's data. It gets an ArrayList of strings, checks errors, and then sends the filter and order value
in each section to the CurrentSection class.
CommandFile.java - represents a CommandFile, which is a type of File. Extends FileFacade.java.
TypeTwoExceptions.java - This class includes nested classes of the possible type two errors. Extends Exception.java class.
CurrentSecssion.java - saves the data for the current secssion.
FilterFactory.java - Holds all possible types of filter, and implements the filter method according to each filter type, returns an FileFilter instance
SecessionCreationException.java - This class includes nested classes of the possible Filter/Sorter creation errors. Extends Exception.java.
SortFactory.java - Holds all possible types of sorter, implements the sorting methods.

=          Design           =
=============================
The design is as following: In the SectionProcessor package are the following java classes: CurrentSecssion, FilterFactory, SecessionCreationException,
SortFactory. The classes are in the same package because they are used to filter and order the files.
The FilterFactory and SortFactory uses enum because it saves constants values and it doesn't change when the program is running.
It is also very simple to add a new filter/order type - we simply add it to the enum, and no more work is needed. That's why it uses the Single
Choice principle. The methodology of FilterFactory and SortFactory are equal, only that the FilterFactory has more parameters to filter.
Exceptions - there are two basic classes of Exceptions, one for type 1 exceptions and the other one for type 2 exceptions.
The SecssionCreationException is not private and that's why it is in the same package with the classes that use this exception.
The exceptions are handeled by the program and print according messages.
We use the factory design pattern in the SortFactory and FilterFactory classes.
